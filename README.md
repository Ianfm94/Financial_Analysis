Finally, there are the three below interactive graphs made in R:
   1. [A comparison of four large US airlines daily stock price movement's based solely on trading hours]
(https://ianfm94.github.io/Financial_Analysis/LSTM_Workings/Airline_Visualizations/US%20Airline%20Price%20RoR's.html)
   2. [A comparison of four large US airlines daily stock price movement's including after hours trading]
(https://ianfm94.github.io/Financial_Analysis/LSTM_Workings/Airline_Visualizations/US%20Airline%20Price%20RoR's%20including%20after%20hours%20trades.html)
   3. [RoR Difference between Normal Trading Hours and After Hours Trades
(https://ianfm94.github.io/Financial_Analysis/LSTM_Workings/Airline_Visualizations/Difference%20between%20Trading%20Hours%20and%20After%20Hours%20RoR's.html)
