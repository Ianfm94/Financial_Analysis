**Various Financial_Analysis Workings**

  In the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) folder, I have included the raw data I collected using a Python script from the 
  yahoo finance website saved in a csv file, the two interactive graphs (one for Daily Closing Price and another for the 
  Daily RoR of the DJIA from roughly 1985 to May 2020), a zip folder where you can download both graphs (Github won't show
  the two graphs in all their glory) and finally the R script itself where I made the graphs using ggplot2 and plotly.
