**Various Financial_Analysis Workings**

  In the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) folder, I have included 6 items:
  1. A python script used to download a csv file of historical stock price information for the DJIA.
  2. The csv file I created in the above step.
  3. An interactive graph of the DJIA historical closing price info.
  4. An interactive graph of the DJIA historical Daily RoR info.
  5. A zip folder where you can download both the above graphs (Github won't show the two graphs in all their glory).
  6. Finally, the R script itself where I made the graphs using ggplot2 and plotly.
